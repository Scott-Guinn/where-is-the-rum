# Where is the Rum? #
  >  "True enough, this compass does not point north."
     "...Where does it point?"
     "It points to the thing you want most in this world."

## Summary ##
  > A pirate on the high seas is lost without his err, rum... so why is the rum always gone? Guided by nothing but a compass that doesn't point north, 'Where-is-the-rum?' will lead brave adventurers to the thing they want most... as long as that thing is a healthy drink at the local pub. 'Where-is-the-rum?' is a compass that points to the nearest bar or restaurant, where they can refill their stocks and carry on their courageous or nefarious deeds.

## What is happening here? ##
  > When a lost adventurer needs a drink, any amount of complexity is too much. No waypoints or distances or fancy charts. Just point the user in the right direction!
  > A mobile version of this application is currently in production! (see [rum-compass](https://github.com/Scott-Guinn/rum-compass))

  > This was the first version (implemented on web) and does not take user's heading into account. The front end simply points the compass in the direction of the nearest bar or pub.
    > Some additional functionality was added to the web version for experimentation (Note: this additional functionality is "hidden" and can only be used by those who already know how to use it... aka try clicking around)
      - User can request a bearing to an alternative destination (input by user, default is "rum")
      - User can see the the past 15 user requests

  > The backend Express server is currently being utilized for development of the mobile version.
